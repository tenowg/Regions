          <h3>What is Regions</h3>

<p>Regions was a simple project to help create regions for a spout server, it is intended to be extended and used by other plugins by the creation of "Features". Each regions is basicly a container to hold several features that can be maintained and updated by external plugins.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unlimited Features (Developers can create thier own)</li>
  <li>Annotation Driven (Very simple to create)</li>
  <li>Region/Feature commands (Each feature can be programmed with commands)</li>
  <li>Very little or no configuration needed (just drop in and restart)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>The commands in regions are designed for administration and manually "fixing" any problems that might arise (plugin conflicts?). There are some very special commands that can cause alot of damage to a server if used by the wrong user, so be careful and remember, most of these commands are pretty raw and as mentioned a dozen times, ment for admin use only.</p>

<h3>Permissions</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, Region is designed to be extended, therefore it doesn't have all the bell and whisles to its permissions system that more detailed plugins will have. As the system was ment to be used by admins, almost all permissions are based on whether you are admin or not. While it is still possible to give permissions to regular users it is not advisable, let the plugins that extend Regions do the work.</p>

<h3>Example Feature Code</h3>
<pre><code>
  public class InRegion extends Feature implements Tickable { 
    /*
    * Marking something as @RegionEvent will make this method
    * fire everytime the event Type (in this case PlayerChatEvent) is
    * fired by Spout. Each Features events are parsed on loadup and
    * automaticly registered with Spout's EventManager.
    */
    @RegionEvent
    public void executeIt(PlayerChatEvent event, EventRegion region) {
        chatEvent.getPlayer().sendMessage("You Chatted in " + region.getName());
    }
    
    @RegionEvent
    @EventOrder(Order.EARLY)
    public void execute(PlayerQuitEvent event, EventRegion region) {
        // Do something when a player quits while in region.
        // EventOrder tells the Spout EventManager to run the event early.
    }

    @FeatureCommand(alias = "test")
    @FearureCommandPermission("test")
    public void commandTest(FeatureCommandArgs args) {
        // Do some command based on permission "raz.feature.{regionname}.test"
    }

    @OnTick
    public void tickTask(float dt) {
        // Will always run, as the default load is Intensity.IGNORE
    }

    @OnTick(load = Intensity.LOW)
    public void someTask(float dt) {
        // Do Something on Tick, will not run if TPS is 8 or lower
    }
}
