/**
 * OnTick is a Annotation that needs to be placed on any method
 * in a Feature that needs to fire every tick, multiple methods within
 * a feature can have OnTick placed on them.
 * The OnTick annotation takes one optional argument of "load" to indicate how
 * much work this OnTick method does, and whether or not to process this method.
 * <p>
 * <code>@OnTick(load = Intensity.LOW, freq = 1)</code>
 * <p>
 * The default is Ignore which means this will happen every tick and doesn't 
 * check the TPS of the server. To use the default you don't need to set
 * the argument
 * <p>
 * <code>@OnTick
 * public void someMethod(float dt, Region region)
